# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Mapping_Earthquakes
I created a website that adds earthquake and tecatonic plate data from GeoJSON files to a map using Leaflet.js and Mapbox. 

## Results
I was able to customize the map such that when you click on a marker it displays the magnitude and size of the earthquake.

As you can see in the image above, in the top right corner you can toggle between three different map styles: Streets, Satellite, and Dark. Additionally, in the bottom right corner, there is a legend that shows that the different colors of each circle correlate with different magnitude ranges.

## Summary
This was an extremely fun project. There's a lot that can be accomplished with Leaflet and GeoJSON data. I am excited to dive deeper into this topic and learn more unique method of mapping various datasets.
